# Sprint 3: Code Refactoring and Simplification

## Goal
The primary goal of this sprint is to perform a comprehensive review and refactoring of the existing codebase. The focus is on eliminating unnecessary layers of abstraction, removing redundant code, and improving overall code clarity and maintainability without altering existing functionality.

## Key Areas of Focus
- **Review Abstraction Layers:** Analyze current abstractions (e.g., adapters, services, interfaces) to identify and collapse any that do not provide significant value or add unnecessary complexity.
- **Simplify Core Logic:** Refactor the trading logic in `ArbitrageTrader` and `ReverseArbitrageTrader` to be more direct and readable.
- **Consolidate Exchange-Specific Code:** Review the `Exchanges` folder to find opportunities for code consolidation and reduction of boilerplate.
- **Dependency Audit:** Check for and remove any unused or redundant dependencies.
- **YAGNI/KISS Principles:** Apply "You Aren't Gonna Need It" and "Keep It Simple, Stupid" principles across the entire solution.
